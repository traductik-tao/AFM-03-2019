2
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,820
So I'm a clinical cardiologist and I run

3
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,340
a dedicated cardiology clinic for

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,340
pediatric age and adults with various

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,820
inherited neuromuscular disorders.

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,340
Most of the patients are Duchenne or Becker

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,660
but there's a mixture of other conditions

8
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,100
and I work very closely with

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,260
John Wharton muscle team at the

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,660
International Center for Life in Newcastle.

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,260
The main focus of my research

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,980
for the last... well, nearly ten years

13
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,180
has been a randomized study seeing whether

14
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,420
protective treatment for the heart

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,820
in Duchenne patients can delay the onset

16
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,180
of heart muscle weakness or change

17
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,180
the trajectory of left ventricular dysfunction

18
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,820
So, eighty five boys were recruited

19
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,740
between the ages of five and thirteen

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,900
and followed for a minimum of three years.

21
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,590
We treated them with a combination of

22
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,040
perindopril — that's an ACE inhibitor

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,340
and a beta blocker : prepared bisoprolol.

24
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,340
and there was a placebo comparator group.

25
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,820
Somewhat disappointingly, the results do not show

26
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,660
any group benefit after three years of treatment

27
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,980
but we think that's partly explained

28
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,300
by the fact that younger patients,

29
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,630
and the variation in the age of onset of muscle weakness

30
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,340
won't show in a three-year time period

31
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,580
So we're hoping to follow the patients for longer.

32
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,940
There are beginning to be some changes

33
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,900
which may prove to be interesting but

34
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,860
at the moment we have to conclude,

35
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,900
that after three years of treatment,

36
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,700
there is no difference between active and placebo treatment.

37
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,350
So essentially, if I'm a scientist I would say that the study is negative.

38
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,540
If on the other hand I'm a clinician I believe that

39
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,280
the treatments are beneficial for the heart in Duchenne

40
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,490
because we know already that once we detect

41
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,090
muscle weakness at an early stage,

42
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:22,670
the trajectory of the decline in heart function is helped and slowed

43
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,700
by the treatments we were testing.

44
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,340
So I think it's more an effect of saying

45
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,140
the earlier you start a treatment,

46
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,380
the harder it is to show a benefit!

47
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,940
 The AFM of course is pivotal in providing

48
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,740
funding for a wide range of research,

49
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,020
and it also ensures a balance between

50
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,540
the investigation of different conditions.

51
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,260
The AFM I think is essential to maintaining

52
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,220
the momentum that's been built up over recent years,

53
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,620
and is allowing translation of research,

54
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,060
and the relevance of basic science and molecular biology

55
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,060
into the clinic much faster...

56
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,180
So, the research funding is critical,

57
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,900
the networking is critical,

58
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,780
 the meetings under the auspices of the organization

59
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,780
ensure spreading of information

60
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,540
much, much more rapidly than traditional methods!

61
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:18,900
